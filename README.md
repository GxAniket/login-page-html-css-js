# login-page-html-css-js
A responsive and modern login page built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Includes demo links to “Forgot Password?” and “Sign Up” pages for frontend presentation purposes only. These pages are static and do not perform real authentication — ideal for UI/UX demos or company evaluation.
